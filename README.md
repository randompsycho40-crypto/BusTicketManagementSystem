# 🚌 Bus Ticket Management System

A desktop-based **Bus Ticket Management System** developed using **C# Windows Forms** and **Microsoft SQL Server**.

The system is designed to manage bus operators, buses, routes, schedules, seat booking, customer payments, operator commissions, and administrative reports through a role-based interface.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Bus Ticket Management System** provides a complete digital solution for managing bus ticket operations.

The system has three main user roles:

* 👑 **Super Admin** — Manages the overall system, operators, payments, commissions, and reports.
* 🚌 **Bus Operator / Admin** — Manages buses, routes, schedules, bookings, and operator payments.
* 👤 **Customer / Ticket Buyer** — Searches available buses, selects seats, books tickets, and completes payments.

The application uses a centralized SQL Server database to store and manage users, buses, routes, schedules, bookings, seats, payments, and related information.

## 📊 Super Admin Dashboard

The Super Admin dashboard provides an overview of the system through several statistical cards.

Important metrics include:

* Total Operators
* Total Buses
* Total Tickets Sold
* Total Sales
* Platform Revenue / Commission
* Received Operator Payments
* Pending Operator Payments
* Overdue Operator Payments

These statistics help the system owner monitor the overall performance of the platform.

---

## 🎫 Booking Process

The customer booking process is designed to be straightforward:

1. Customer logs into the system.
2. Customer searches for available buses.
3. Customer selects a schedule.
4. Available seats are displayed.
5. Customer selects one or more seats.
6. Booking information is prepared.
7. Customer proceeds to payment.
8. Payment is completed.
9. Booking status is updated.
10. Selected seats are stored against the booking.

The system uses transactional database operations during booking/payment confirmation to maintain data consistency.

---

## 🧾 Database Transaction

Booking confirmation involves multiple related database operations.

Conceptually:

```text
BEGIN TRANSACTION

      ↓

Create Booking

      ↓

Store Selected Seats

      ↓

Create Payment

      ↓

Update Booking Status

      ↓

COMMIT TRANSACTION
```

If an error occurs, the transaction can be rolled back to avoid incomplete booking records.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Open the Project

Open the following solution in **Visual Studio**:

```text
BusTicketManagementSystem.sln
```

### 3. Configure SQL Server

Make sure **SQL Server LocalDB** is installed.

The project expects:

```text
(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB
```

### 4. Create the Database

Open the SQL database script:

```text
database.sql
```

Execute the script in SQL Server Management Studio or Visual Studio's SQL tools.

This creates the required:

```text
BusTicketManagementSystem
```

database and its tables.

### 5. Check the Connection String

Make sure the connection string points to:

```text
Data Source=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB;
Initial Catalog=BusTicketManagementSystem;
Integrated Security=True;
```

### 6. Build the Project

In Visual Studio:

```text
Build → Build Solution
```
